    Abstraction used to transform keyboard input into a two-dimensional control space. Each key pressed corresponds
    to a vertical and horizontal position, which is passed to the callback function, along with (optionally)
    whether it was an up or down keystroke and what modifiers were present.

    :param callback: a function of the form "callback(coordinates, up_or_down, modifiers)". Can also have the
        signature "callback(coordinates, up_or_down)" or "callback(coordinates)", in which case it is simply not
        passed that information.
    :param normalize_coordinates: if True, the keys coordinates go from 0-1 horizontally and vertically. if False,
        they go from 0-3 (inclusive) vertically and 0-9, 10 or 11 horizontally (depending on row)
