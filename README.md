# scamp_extensions

_scamp_extensions_ contains various extensions to the [SCAMP framework](https://pypi.org/project/scamp/) for composing algorithmic music.

This package is the place for  models of music-theoretical concepts (e.g. scales, pitch-class sets), conveniences for interacting with various types of input and output, and in general anything that builds upon SCAMP but is outside of the scope of the main framework.
