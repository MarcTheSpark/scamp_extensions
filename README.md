# scamp_extensions

_scamp_extensions_ contains various extensions to the [SCAMP framework](https://pypi.org/project/scamp/) for computer-assisted music composition.

This package is the place for models of music-theoretical concepts (e.g. scales, pitch-class sets), conveniences for interacting with various types of input and output, and in general anything that builds upon SCAMP but is outside of the scope of the main framework.

## Installation

Needless to say, scamp_extensions depends up on *scamp*. The easiest way to install *scamp_extensions* is through pip:

```
pip3 install --user scamp_extensions
```

To install the most up-to-date version (assuming you have git installed), you can instead run:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/MarcTheSpark/scamp_extensions
```

This will install the latest version from this repo.
