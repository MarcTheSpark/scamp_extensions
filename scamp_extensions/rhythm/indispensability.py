"""
Re-implementation and extension of Clarence Barlow's concept of rhythmic indispensability such that it works for
additive meters (even nested additive meters). Since these are my own extensions of Barlow's ideas, they are here
instead of in :mod:`scamp_extensions.composers.barlicity`.

    Generates an array of indispensability values for a meter and subdivision, as expressed by a meter arithmetic
    expression. Such expressions allow great flexibility in describing metric structure, making possible additive,
    multiplicative, and hybrid metrical structures.

    :param meter_arithmetic_expression: An string expression representing a metric hierarchy (meter and subdivision
        structure). For instance, "2 * 3" would create the eighth-note subdivisions of 6/8, and "2 + 3 + 2" would create
        an additive meter (2+3+2)/8.  "(2 + 3 + 2) * 3" would create a kind of hybrid of these: seven main beats in a
        2 + 3 + 2 pattern, each of which is subdivided in 3. This might be notated as 6/8+9/8+6/8.
    :param normalize: if True, indispensabilities range from 0 to 1. If false, they count up from 0.
    :param break_up_large_numbers: if True, numbers greater than 3 are broken up into a sum of 2's
        followed by one 3 if odd. This is the Barlow approach.
    :param upbeats_before_group_length: see description in :func:`metric_structure.flatten_beat_groups`. Affects the
        result when there are groups of uneven length at some level of metric structure. To achieve the standard
        Barlowian result, set this to False. I think it works better as True, though.
