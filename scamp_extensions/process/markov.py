"""
Module containing the :class:`MarkovModel` and :class:`MarkovIterator` classes for analyzing and resynthesizing a
sequence based on Markov analysis. Capable of fractional order resynthesis.
Relies upon an embedded copy of the `pykov` (https://github.com/riccardoscalco/Pykov) library, which in turn relies
upon the `numpy`, `scipy`, and `six` libraries.
