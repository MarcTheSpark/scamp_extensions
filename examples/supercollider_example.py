SCAMP Extensions Example: SuperCollider made easy

This example requires the scamp_extensions Python package, which offers a simple way of doing the sound synthesis in
SuperCollider while scripting in SCAMP. Note that, for this to work, sclang must be added to your path (if you open a
terminal and type "sclang", it should act like it knows what you mean).
