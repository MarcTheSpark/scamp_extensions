# This sets up a new viola instrument within Session s that can do arco, pizzicato and harmonic playback
# the first line creates the instrument using Session s and names it "viola".
# we can then add presets to the instrument, giving each preset a name, a ScampInstrument or soundfont preset to use,
# and properties/notations that get bundled with the notes when that preset is used.
# `bundled_properties` get attached to every note played by a preset
# `bundled_properties_on_switch` get attached to the first note played by a preset when we switch to it
# `bundled_properties_on_switch_away` get attached to the next note when we switch away from a preset. This is usually
# a "cancelling" notation, like "arco" after a section of "pizz"
